            Administration Section runs under the administration of Senior Manager (Human Resources and Legal). The approved cadre of the entity is 190 and all administrative functions required for this cadre is performed by the Administrative Section. This Section is responsible for a host of duties such as recruitment of workers, confirmation in service, promotion, retirement, disciplinary control and worker training programs etc.</p>

            <p>
            Awareness conferences were held and training opportunities granted during this year in order to enhance worker performance. Opportunities were granted to Circle Leaders appointed for the Training Workshops on Productivity conducted by Productivity Secretariat. This brought about positive changes in the working environment through enhancement of efficiency in the entity, improvement of amity among workers and creation of an orderly fashion in duties performed. In addition, other worker training programs were also operated during year 2012.</p>

            <p>
            Bonus payments were made for employees in the entity for some 30 years since even before the time it was taken over by the government, and this payment was continued without taking the factors of production data or attendance for service into consideration. In its place, an arrangement has been made at present to make annual bonus payments taking worker efficiency into consideration. It is a matter of pleasure that we have been able to build up confidence on Management through constant action required for close relations between employees and employers</p>

            <p>
            Recruitment during the year 2012 for the posts fallen vacant in the approved cadre are as follows.

            <strong>Human resource of the Thriposha Ltd.</strong>

            <p>Before the emergence of the Revolution for Freedom of Thought, labourers who worked in the factories throughout the world had to suffer a very low standard of life by shredding their sweat and working as slaves. There were no facilities at all for the workforce during that period of economy with exploitation of human labour. 18 Gradually, the world woke up to the need of freedom and free thought and with the recognition of human labor, the workers claimed comparatively a higher bargaining power.</p>
            <p>The "cadre" then has turned out to be "human resource" today. Personnel Management has turned out to be Human Resource Management. We identify also the human resource in the Thriposha Ltd., as a very valuable asset. We are pleased to have a human resource which is fully dedicated for rendering a valuable service to the beneficiaries by up grading renown of the Company and protecting it.</p>
            <p>Our institution may be identified as an entity which renders its service based on a production process. Our team of workers is diligently engaged in a day and night continuation of a process of production for the purpose of timely distribution of Thriposha supplementary food for some million beneficiaries living in villages and colonies. Thriposha Management is frequently on the look out for providing necessary facilities to our human resource made of such a team.</p>
            <p>The total cadre approved by the Department of Management Services for our institution is approximately 190 personnel. It is this limited team which actively provides its contribution for the entire process of production and distribution of some 17,000 Metric Tons of Thriposha per year for the beneficiaries scattered throughout the island. Our staff performs a noble national role in the mission of enhancing the nutrition power of the Nation through this nutritious food produced very cleanly for the child in the motherâ€™s womb, the pregnant mother and to the breast feeding mother for her infant suffering from nutrition requirements and for small children suffering from such nutrition requirements.</p>

            <p>Quality Control Section functions under the Manager (Quality Preservation). Thriposha additional food which is used as an additional food for pregnant mothers,breast feeding mothers, infants and patients etc., should be prepared cleanly and with a proper standard under strict quality inspections. Therefore, the Quality Control Section should perform a massive role for this purpose under constant inspections.</p>

            <p>First of all, raw materials including maize, soya beans etc., required for Thriposha production are thoroughly checked for proper standard in taking over to the manufactory from suppliers. The checking also includes microbe testing, physical testing and other testing in the Laboratory.</p>

            <p>There are many instances when the containers of substandard raw materials brought to be produced to the Thriposha Company happen to be returned for the reason that such raw materials are proved to be not up to the standard expected. The process of production of Thriposha additional food is started by using raw materials in proper standard. Frequent sample testing is done at the Laboratory and Thriposha, in very good condition, is ultimately transferred to the Packing Section. Quality testing process runs up to the final stage of issuing Thriposha additional food to be distributed to beneficiaries. It is as a result of this process that Thriposha has become a fresh, tasty, nutritious and splendid additional food in high standard.</p>
